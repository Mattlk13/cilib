CIlib is a library of various computational intelligence
algorithms. The goal of the project is to create a library that can be used
and referenced by individuals and researchers alike.

The goals of the project are:
 * To provide a type-safe library, preventing as many runtime errors and
   invalid data representations as possible
 * Allow for the perfect reproduction of simulations, enabling researchers
   to validate and reuse previous work and published results with confidence
 * Enable composition, reducing the need to repeat implementations

CIlib is not a "framework", instead the library is a set of a few very simple
abstractions, and allows for a principled manner to define computational
intelligence algorithms and uses several typeclasses such as `Functor` and
`Monad`.
